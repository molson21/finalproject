            <!--Introduction-->
            <p id="opening">In the course BATECH189 - Webpage Authoring Essentials, I've significantly expanded my understanding of HTML and CSS, moving from basic knowledge to a solid grasp of web development. I've learned to structure web pages using semantic HTML, create visually appealing layouts with CSS, and effectively use web fonts and color schemes to enhance readability and user experience. Through projects like designing a city guide, embedding responsive videos, and publishing sites via GitHub Pages, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience that has improved my ability to build well-organized, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing web pages. This course has given me the confidence and skills to tackle more complex web development tasks.</p>

                <h3>Labwork 3: Environmental Issue Website</h3>
                <p>For this project, I created a three-page website that educates visitors about an environmental issue using HTML5 and CSS. The site includes a Home page, an About page, and a Resources page, each with semantic HTML elements, images, and appropriate content. I also implemented basic CSS to ensure a consistent design across all pages, emphasizing clean code and proper file organization. I enjoyed finding photos to match my content and then learning how to cite them using html.</p>

                <h3>Web Project 1: Resume</h3>
                <p>For this first project, I created a simple text based web page using HTML5 that serves as a beginning portfolio or resume. The project focused on understanding HTML structure and included essential elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and lists. The content highlighted my name, contact information, education, work experience, career goals, interests, and favorite websites. This was my first experience with figuring out how to turn a list into navigation. I was a simple site but I liked the challenge of trying all the new elements we learned.</p>

                <h3>Web Project 2: Single Page, 5 Sections</h3>
                <p>For this project, I designed a single webpage with five sections, focusing on a topic of my choice. I choose to have some fun with this project and use a bit of humor using my own photos of my cat Moon. The page features semantic HTML for proper structure, internal CSS for styling, and images with appropriate citations to enhance the content. The project demonstrates my skills in creating accessible, well-organized, and visually appealing web content, while adhering to best practices in web development.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Web Project 3: Favorite City</h3>
                <p>For this project, I created a single-page website about Long Beach, WA, using semantic HTML and CSS to showcase popular attractions and unique aspects of the city. The page includes descriptive text, images with proper citations, and links to relevant resources, all while demonstrating advanced web design techniques like floating elements and responsive layout. The project was hosted on GitHub Pages, allowing for public access. This was my first attempt at using float and it was challenging and rewarding. I have always enjoyed designing to a grid for orgnization.</p>

                <h3>Web Project 5: Multimedia</h3>
                <p>For this project, I developed a webpage that showcases three embedded videos centered around the artist Imogen Heap, utilizing semantic HTML and CSS for a clean and accessible layout. The page features a header, footer, and three sections, each containing a video with accompanying text and proper citations, as well as the integration of web fonts to enhance typography. The design follows best practices for responsive web design, ensuring the videos adapt to various screen sizes. The most difficult thing about this project was finding videos that would embed by this artist.</p>
